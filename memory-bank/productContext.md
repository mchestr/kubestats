# Product Context: Kubestats

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The Kubernetes ecosystem is vast and rapidly evolving, making it difficult for developers, DevOps engineers, and project maintainers to:
- Discover relevant tools and projects in the k8s/container space
- Understand which projects are gaining traction vs declining
- Identify emerging trends in Kubernetes tooling
- Make informed decisions about technology adoption
- Track the health and activity of ecosystem projects

### Market Gap
While GitHub provides basic repository statistics, there's no dedicated platform that:
- Focuses specifically on the Kubernetes/container ecosystem
- Provides historical trend analysis over time
- Aggregates data across multiple topic tags
- Offers comparative analysis between similar projects
- Tracks ecosystem health metrics

## How It Should Work

### User Journey: Community Member
1. **Discovery**: User visits Kubestats to explore k8s ecosystem
2. **Browse**: Views trending repositories, popular languages, growing projects
3. **Analyze**: Examines historical growth patterns and metrics
4. **Compare**: Evaluates similar tools side-by-side
5. **Track**: Monitors projects of interest over time

### User Journey: Project Maintainer
1. **Benchmark**: Compares their project against ecosystem averages
2. **Monitor**: Tracks their project's growth and community engagement
3. **Research**: Identifies successful patterns from similar projects
4. **Plan**: Makes data-driven decisions about project direction

### Core User Experience Goals
