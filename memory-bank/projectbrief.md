# Project Brief: Kubestats

## Project Overview

Kubestats is a comprehensive Kubernetes ecosystem analysis platform that combines GitHub repository discovery with advanced Kubernetes resource scanning and lifecycle tracking. Built on FastAPI and React, it automatically discovers, tracks, and analyzes GitHub repositories tagged with Kubernetes topics while providing deep insights into Kubernetes resource patterns, configurations, and evolution across the ecosystem.

## Core Mission

**Automatically discover, analyze, and provide comprehensive insights into the Kubernetes/container ecosystem through GitHub repository tracking and advanced Kubernetes resource lifecycle analytics.**

## Key Requirements

### Primary Features
1. **Repository Discovery**: Automated discovery of GitHub repositories with specific Kubernetes-related topics
2. **Kubernetes Resource Scanning**: Advanced YAML parsing and Kubernetes resource extraction from repositories
3. **Resource Lifecycle Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of resource creation, modification, and deletion events
4. **Time-Series Analytics**: Track both repository metrics and resource evolution over time
5. **Resource Event Analytics**: Interactive visualization and analysis of resource lifecycle events
6. **Ecosystem Insights**: Provide statistical analysis of both repository trends and Kubernetes resource patterns
7. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Periodic updates of repository statistics and resource scanning via background tasks

### Technical Requirements
- Built on FastAPI full-stack template (Python backend, React frontend)
- PostgreSQL database with enhanced schema for repositories, metrics, resources, and events
- Celery for background task processing including repository sync and resource scanning
- GitHub API integration via direct HTTPX client with content access for YAML scanning
- Advanced YAML scanner framework with modular resource scanners
- Resource lifecycle event tracking and analytics system
- Interactive frontend with resource analytics dashboards
- Docker Compose deployment with enhanced scanning capabilities

## Success Criteria

1. **Discovery System**: Successfully finds and catalogs repositories with target topics
2. **Resource Scanning**: Accurately parses and tracks Kubernetes resources across repositories
3. **Event Analytics**: Provides comprehensive resource lifecycle event tracking and visualization
4. **Data Quality**: Accurate time-series metrics collection for both repositories and resources
5. **Performance**: Handles periodic discovery and scanning tasks without performance degradation
6. **Analytics**: Provides meaningful insights into repository trends, resource patterns, and ecosystem health
7. **User Experience**: Clean, responsive interface for exploring repository data and resource analytics
8. **Resource Intelligence**: Delivers actionable insights into Kubernetes resource adoption and best practices

## Current Project Scope

### In Scope
- GitHub repository discovery for `kubesearch` and `k8s-at-home` topics
- Repository metadata and metrics tracking
- **Kubernetes resource scanning and extraction from repository YAML files**
- **Resource lifecycle event tracking (creation, modification, deletion)**
- **Resource analytics dashboard with interactive filtering and visualization**
- Time-series analytics and trend analysis for both repositories and resources
- RESTful API for repository data access and resource analytics
- Enhanced frontend interface with resource analytics capabilities
- Background task system for automated discovery and resource scanning
- **Cross-repository resource pattern analysis and best practice identification**

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Real-time webhooks from GitHub
- Advanced ML-based trend prediction for resource evolution
- Multi-platform repository discovery (beyond GitHub)
- Enterprise user management features
- Live Kubernetes cluster integration
- Security analysis and compliance checking for resources
- Advanced dependency mapping between resources

## Project Context

This project serves the Kubernetes community by providing insights into:
- Popular tools and projects in the k8s ecosystem
- **Kubernetes resource configuration patterns and best practices**
- **Resource lifecycle trends and adoption patterns across repositories**
- Growth trends and community adoption patterns
- Community engagement metrics
- Technology landscape evolution
- **Resource-level ecosystem intelligence and trend analysis**

The system is designed to be extensible for additional analysis types, resource scanners, and data sources as the project grows.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features âœ…
- **Complete repository discovery and analytics platform**
- **Advanced Kubernetes resource scanning framework with modular scanners**
- **Comprehensive resource lifecycle event tracking and analytics**
- **Interactive resource analytics dashboard with filtering and visualization**
- **Enhanced database schema with resource and event tables**
- **Background scanning tasks with change detection and event generation**
- **Frontend interface with resource analytics integration**
- **API endpoints for resource and event data access**

### Implementation Maturity
- **Backend**: 98% complete with full resource scanning capabilities
- **Frontend**: 90% complete with comprehensive resource analytics
- **Integration**: 95% complete with end-to-end resource pipeline
- **Platform**: Production-ready with advanced analytics capabilities

### Key Differentiators
- **Unique resource-level analysis**: No other platform provides deep Kubernetes resource lifecycle tracking
- **Automated scanning**: Continuous resource discovery and change detection
- **Ecosystem intelligence**: Cross-repository resource pattern analysis
- **Community focus**: Open source platform serving the Kubernetes community
- **Comprehensive analytics**: Both repository and resource trend analysis

Kubestats has evolved into a comprehensive Kubernetes ecosystem analysis platform that provides unique insights into both repository trends and Kubernetes resource patterns, serving as an essential tool for the Kubernetes community.
