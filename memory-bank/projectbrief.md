# Project Brief: Kubestats

## Project Overview

Kubestats is a GitHub repository discovery and analytics platform focused on the Kubernetes/container ecosystem. Built on the FastAPI full-stack template, it automatically discovers, tracks, and analyzes GitHub repositories tagged with `kubesearch` and `k8s-at-home` topics.

## Core Mission

**Automatically discover and provide statistical analysis of the Kubernetes/container ecosystem through GitHub repository tracking.**

## Key Requirements

### Primary Features
1. **Repository Discovery**: Automated discovery of GitHub repositories with specific Kubernetes-related topics
2. **Time-Series Analytics**: Track repository metrics (stars, forks, issues) over time
3. **Ecosystem Insights**: Provide statistical analysis of the Kubernetes development landscape
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Periodic updates of repository statistics via background tasks

### Technical Requirements
- Built on FastAPI full-stack template (Python backend, React frontend)
- PostgreSQL database with time-series metrics storage
- Celery for background task processing
- GitHub API integration via direct HTTPX client
- Docker Compose deployment

## Success Criteria

1. **Discovery System**: Successfully finds and catalogs repositories with target topics
2. **Data Quality**: Accurate time-series metrics collection and storage
3. **Performance**: Handles periodic discovery tasks without performance degradation
4. **Analytics**: Provides meaningful insights into repository trends and ecosystem health
5. **User Experience**: Clean, responsive interface for exploring repository data

## Current Project Scope

### In Scope
- GitHub repository discovery for `kubesearch` and `k8s-at-home` topics
- Repository metadata and metrics tracking
- Time-series analytics and trend analysis
- RESTful API for repository data access
- Frontend interface for data visualization
- Background task system for automated discovery

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Real-time webhooks from GitHub
- Advanced ML-based trend prediction
- Multi-platform repository discovery (beyond GitHub)
- Enterprise user management features

## Project Context

This project serves the Kubernetes community by providing insights into:
- Popular tools and projects in the k8s ecosystem
- Growth trends and adoption patterns
- Community engagement metrics
- Technology landscape evolution

The system is designed to be extensible for additional analysis types and data sources as the project grows.
